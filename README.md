The four pillars of an application represent those foundation values which distinguish the organisation.

### Reliability

Software that is **Reliable** can be sold with **Confidence**. Confidence is one of those amazing fuels
which propel the software into the wider arena. When consumers of software are confident in the software,
their productivity is unimpeded by the software. When producers of the software are confident in the software,
the producers are able to make claims about the software which will attract more consumers to the software.

As an organisation that offers reliability packaged into its array of products and services will attract
repeat business, and reputation will build for that organisation whose software is rigorously tested
before it is released onto the market.

### Evolution

Software that is evolving is malleable, responding to external pressure. It is the harnessing of this property
that allows producers of software to react to business forces. A **SOLID** foundation will prepare
the software for continued malleability, allowing it to grow and change with the consumers of that software.

Evolution underpins the software's ability to remain relevant. To stay in use, software needs to add and remove
features and sometimes split or merge with other software. Business *systems* utilise software *ecosystems* and
the application of certain survival traits found in observed ecosystems.
